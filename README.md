## Task 2-Call Center Analysis
#### Problem Statement
The purpose of this analysis is to create a dashboard in PowerBI for call canter manager that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.Focus on customer satisfaction, call volumes, and agent performance to aid in identifying areas for improvement in call centre operations.
#### Insights
The call center handles 5,000 calls, with an 81.08% answer rate and an 18.92% missed call rate. Call volume remains stable across January to March. The highest inquiries relate to Streaming, Technical Support, and Payment Issues, indicating a need for self-service options like FAQs or chatbots. Agent performance varies, with Stewart handling the most calls (536) and Martha the least (514), while the average speed of answer (67.52s) may require improvement if above industry benchmarks. Customer satisfaction (3.40/6.81) is below optimal, hinting at possible service quality issues. Additionally, 27.08% of issues remain unresolved, highlighting the need for better resolution strategies and follow-ups to enhance service effectiveness.
#### Recommendations
To improve call handling efficiency, analyze missed call trends by time and optimize staffing, while implementing callback options and AI chatbots to handle common inquiries. For call volume trends, introduce predictive analytics and self-service tools to reduce load. Address high-volume topics (Streaming, Tech Support, Payments) by enhancing FAQs and automating responses. Improve agent performance by tracking calls answered vs. handle time, providing real-time coaching, and gamifying performance. Boost customer satisfaction by reducing wait times, improving first-call resolution, and offering personalized interactions. Finally, lower the 27.08% unresolved issue rate by creating a knowledge base, assigning specialized teams, and implementing follow-up mechanisms to ensure better resolution outcomes.

## Task 3-Customer Retention
#### Problem Statement
The purpose of this analysis is to create a dashboard in PowerBI in response to a request from the telecom's Retention Manager, showcasing key metrics related to customer loyalty and retention. It visualizes data to predict customer churn and identifies potential strategies to enhance customer retention.

#### Insights
The highest churn risk is among month-to-month contract customers (88.55%), especially those with a tenure of less than one year (55.48%). Customers paying via electronic check (57.3%) and those with multiple tech/admin support tickets are also more likely to leave. Additionally, fiber optic users show a 41.89% churn rate, indicating possible service concerns. Customers lacking value-added services like tech support, online security, or backups are at higher risk, suggesting that service bundling could improve retention.

#### Recommendations
To reduce churn, the company should promote longer contracts with discounts and added benefits while engaging new customers early through onboarding and personalized outreach. Encouraging a switch from electronic check to autopay with incentives can improve retention. Improving customer support with priority resolution for high-risk customers and offering free trials of tech support or security services can increase satisfaction. Finally, monitoring churn trends through Power BI or Excel and refining retention efforts based on data-driven insights will help reduce customer losses.

## Task 4-Diversity & Inclusion
#### Problem Statement
The purpose of this analysis is to create a dashboard in PowerBI focusing on the telecom client's goal of improving gender balance at the executive management level, this dashboard visualizes metrics related to diversity and inclusion, offering insights into current trends and areas for action.

#### Insights
Women remain underrepresented in senior roles, with executive hiring still predominantly male. While promotions for women improve at junior levels, they decline significantly at higher positions, creating a bottleneck in leadership advancement. Additionally, female turnover is higher in senior roles, further reducing the talent pipeline for executive positions. Performance ratings show no major gender bias, yet men receive slightly more high scores, which may influence promotion decisions. Despite efforts to improve gender balance, progress remains slow, with minimal increases in female executive representation year over year. Women also appear to face mid-career stagnation, limiting their progression to top leadership roles.

#### Recommendations
To improve gender balance at the executive level, the company should focus on targeted senior-level female hiring, expanding recruitment efforts through industry networks and setting diversity goals. Strengthening promotion pathways by implementing leadership development programs, mentorship, and transparent criteria will help more women advance. Retention strategies, such as flexible work policies and executive coaching, can reduce female turnover in senior roles. Ensuring fair performance evaluations through bias training and standardized criteria will support equitable promotions. Lastly, holding leadership accountable by tying diversity goals to executive performance and requiring active sponsorship of female talent will drive sustained progress.
